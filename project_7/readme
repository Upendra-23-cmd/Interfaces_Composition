==> Question : Write a program to Clone io.Reader/Writer with custom types implementing interface

==> Understanding the problem

* io.Reader: Anything that implements the Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) method.
* io.Writer: Anything that implements the Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) method.

==> Cloning here means: we want to duplicate the data being read or written, so multiple consumers can read/write the same data.

* Why custom types?
:- Because Go interfaces allow flexibility: we can wrap any Reader/Writer and extend functionality (like logging, cloning, buffering).
